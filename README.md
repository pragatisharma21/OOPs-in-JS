Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in JavaScript 
This repository showcases my journey of learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts in JavaScript. The repository includes examples, code snippets, and practical implementations to understand and apply OOP principles effectively.

Key Concepts Covered:
Classes and Objects:
Learn how to create and use classes and objects to model real-world entities.

Encapsulation:
Implement encapsulation to bundle data and methods within a class and restrict direct access to some components.

Inheritance:
Understand how to reuse code by inheriting properties and methods from parent classes.

Polymorphism:
Explore how methods can behave differently based on the object calling them.

Abstraction:
Learn to hide complex logic and expose only essential details using abstract concepts.

Static Methods and Properties:
Work with static members in a class that belong to the class itself rather than to an instance.

Constructor Functions:
Understand the use of constructors for initializing objects in JavaScript.
